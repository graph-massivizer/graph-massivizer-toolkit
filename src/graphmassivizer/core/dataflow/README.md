## Computation Graph Structure

- Structured Computation Graph is a fundamental abstraction that represents a dataflow computatiom

- The conceptual building blocks include the following key components:

1. Nodes

   - Source-/Sink-Nodes:

      - Represent fundamental input/output of data from/to sources/sinks

   - Compute-Nodes:

      - Represent fundamental units of computation in the graph

   - State-Nodes:

      - Represent (mutable) state within the graph

   - Proxy-Node:

      - Represents a (generic) docking point for an external ‘interaction’

2. Edges

   - Dataflow-Edges:

           - Represent the data flowing between nodes.

           - Edges carry the output from one node to serve as the input for another.

   - Control-Edges:                                        (TODO: 'Böhm–Jacopini Theorem')

           - Sequence: linear execution

           - Selection: conditional execution

           - Iteration: repeated execution   

3. Scopes                                                   (TODO: must be 1, node/edges must be within scopes)

   - Allows grouping of related Compute-/State-Nodes into logically referenceable compute compounds

## Data Model

Hierarchical Data Model

```
Element
├── Compound
│   ├── Tuple
│   └── Union
├── Aggregate
└── Value
```

- `Element`

   - `Composite[count]`

      - `Compound` heterogen

         - `Union[(type_0 ⨯ ... ⨯ type_n), (type_i ⨯ member_i)]`

         - `Tuple[(type_0 ⨯ member_0), ..., (type_n ⨯ member_n)]

      - `Aggregate[type, count, [member]]`  homogen

   - `Value[size, byte-order, alignment]` primitive

   - `Padding`

### Design Principles

- - **Copy-Free**

    • Eliminate intermediate buffers during message encoding and decoding to reduce byte copying overhead.

    • Data Model Codecs perform direct encoding/decoding to/from the underlying buffer.

    • Implement fragmentation protocols to handle messages exceeding transfer buffer sizes.

- **Native Type Mapping**

  • Encode data as native types within the buffer to leverage direct CPU instructions (e.g., x86 MOV, BSWAP).

  • Define byte order for cross-architecture compatibility, enabling efficient byte swapping.

  • Access fields with performance comparable to high-level language constructs like C++ or Java classes/structs.

- **Allocation-Free**

  • Avoid object allocations to prevent CPU cache churn and garbage collection pauses, enhancing efficiency.

  • Utilize the flyweight pattern to directly encode/decode messages via the underlying buffer without allocations.

  • Store fields separately if retention beyond message processing is required.

- **Streaming Access**

  • Optimize memory access patterns by sequentially progressing through the buffer, ensuring consistent performance and latency.

  • Design Data Model Codecs to encode/decode messages by advancing the buffer position forward, minimizing backtracking.

- **Word Aligned Access**

  • Ensure fields start at byte addresses aligned to their word size (e.g., 64-bit integers on addresses divisible by 8).

  • Define field offsets based on 8-byte boundary framing protocols.

  • Arrange fields in messages by type and descending size to achieve compactness and access efficiency.

### Summary: “Dataflow Architectures” by Arvind and David E. Culler (1986)

1.	Core Concept:
      - Dataflow architectures represent computation as a directed graph where nodes are operations and edges represent data dependencies.
      - Data-driven execution: Nodes are activated when all required inputs (tokens) are available, eliminating the need for explicit control flow.
2.	Dataflow Graph Model:
      - Nodes represent instructions, and edges indicate data dependencies between operations.
      - Computation proceeds asynchronously based on the availability of input data, maximizing parallel execution.
      - Execution is self-synchronizing, driven purely by data availability.
3.	Execution Paradigms:
      - Static Dataflow: Each node can fire only once when all inputs are available. Suitable for simple, predictable workloads.
      - Dynamic Dataflow: Nodes can fire multiple times using tags to differentiate instances, enabling recursive and iterative computations.
4.	Tagged Token Mechanism:
      - Introduces tokens with tags to manage dynamic instances of instructions, allowing for concurrency without conflict.
      - Tags act as unique identifiers, ensuring that multiple invocations of a node (e.g., within loops) can be handled correctly.
      - Facilitates handling of loops, conditionals, and procedural constructs.
5.	Parallelism and Concurrency:
      - Dataflow architectures inherently expose fine-grained parallelism by allowing independent nodes to execute as soon as their inputs are ready.
      - Eliminates the traditional control-flow bottlenecks, enabling high degrees of concurrent execution.
      - Suitable for applications requiring extensive data processing and real-time responsiveness.
6.	Advantages:
      - Latency tolerance: Execution is driven by data readiness, making the system resilient to delays.
      - Scalability of computation: Potential for high parallelism, especially in distributed systems and pipeline processing.
      - Decoupling of program specification from control flow: Emphasizes a data-centric model, separating computation logic from control structures.
7.	Challenges:
      - Overhead of fine-grained control: Managing token synchronization and tags introduces complexity.
      - Resource management: Handling dynamic firing and token storage can be resource-intensive.
      - Scalability limitations: While parallelism is high, practical systems face bottlenecks in managing large-scale token streams and synchronization.
8.	Tagged Token Dataflow Architecture:
      - Arvind and Culler’s model leverages tagged tokens to achieve dynamic dataflow while maintaining correct execution semantics.
      - Tags ensure that each computation context is independent, enabling flexible and dynamic execution patterns.
9.	Theoretical Implications:
      - Dataflow models challenge the dominance of the traditional Von Neumann architecture by focusing on asynchronous, data-driven computation.
      - They present a paradigm shift toward models that align with parallel processing capabilities and distributed computation frameworks.
10.	Practical Applications:
       - Best suited for applications demanding high concurrency (e.g., signal processing, scientific simulations, real-time systems).
       - Foundational in the development of modern parallel programming languages and concurrent computation models.

2.	Programming Model:
      - Users define a directed graph of computations, where nodes represent processing logic and edges carry data as records.
      - Each record consists of a (key, value, timestamp) tuple, allowing fine-grained control over data processing and aggregation.
3.	Key Abstractions:
      - Computations: User-defined nodes that process records and generate outputs. Nodes are keyed, enabling parallel processing per key.

      - Timers: Per-key timers that trigger at specific timestamps or low watermarks, enabling time-based operations like windowed aggregations.
      - Streams: Delivery channels between nodes, ensuring ordered and reliable data transfer.
4.	Fault Tolerance:
      - Provides exactly-once delivery of records through checkpointing and deduplication mechanisms.
      - Uses a tagged token system for idempotent processing, ensuring that duplicate records are detected and discarded.
      - MillWheel ensures atomic updates to state, timers, and outputs to maintain consistency even in the face of machine failures.
5.	Low Watermarks:
      - Introduces the concept of low watermarks to indicate progress in processing time, allowing handling of out-of-order data.
      - Low watermarks provide a bound on event times, ensuring that all earlier records have been processed, which is crucial for windowed aggregations and event-time semantics.
6.	Scalability:
      - Supports dynamic load balancing by distributing work based on key intervals. The system can automatically redistribute load in response to machine failures or resource pressure.
      - Optimizes resource usage through efficient checkpointing and caching mechanisms, reducing overhead and improving throughput.
7.	Use Cases:
      - Widely used for various applications at Google, including real-time anomaly detection, ads processing, and billing systems.
      - Handles petabytes of data while maintaining low latency, proving its scalability and efficiency in real-world deployments.
8.	Performance:
      - Achieves low latency with median record delivery delays in the range of 3-4 milliseconds in optimal conditions.
      - Ensures that latency remains stable even as the system scales up to thousands of nodes.
9.	Challenges and Solutions:
      - Addresses issues like duplicate record processing, out-of-order data, and fault recovery through robust state management and checkpointing.
      - Uses `Aggregate`r tokens to prevent stale writes from old processes, ensuring consistency in distributed environments.
10.	Conclusion:
       - MillWheel provides a robust foundation for real-time, fault-tolerant stream processing with support for complex stateful operations, making it suitable for large-scale, latency-sensitive applications.

# EXPERIMENTAL
Structured Prpgram Theorem for Structured Computation Graph YEEHAA!
A directed graph-based computation model with specialized nodes and edges.
1.	Directed Graph
      - Nodes represent the computational or control units.
      - Edges define the relationships and dependencies between nodes.
2.	Node Types
      - Control-Node:
   - Manages control flow within the graph (e.g., conditionals, loops, branches).
     - Compute-Node:
   - Performs computations, transformations, or processing of data.
     - State-Node:
   - Manages and accesses shared state, providing storage or caching for data across nodes.
3.	Edge Types
      - Control-Flow-Edge:
   - Determines the execution order, directing control from one node to another.
     - Data-Flow-Edge:
   - Transfers data between nodes, connecting output of one node to input of another.
     - State-Access-Edge:
   - Links nodes to state, enabling read or write access to shared state managed by a State-Node.
### Structured Program Theorem
The Böhm-Jacopini theorem states that: Any computable function can be constructed using just three control structures:
- `Aggregate`  (linear execution)
- Selection (conditional execution)
- Iteration (repeated execution)
  These constructs are represented in imperative languages through statements and control flow.
### Structured Computation-Graph
Can these constructs be reified using Computation-Graph model?
Computation-Graph:
- Nodes (Control, Compute, State)
- Edges (Control-Flow, Data-Flow, State-Access)
Model `Aggregate`, selection, and iteration using Computation-Graph abstractions:
1. `Aggregate`
   - Represented as a series of Compute-Nodes connected by Control-Flow-Edges.
   - Data-Flow-Edges can be used to pass results from one Compute-Node to the next in the `Aggregate`.
   - Example:
     Compute-Node A ->(Control-Flow-Edge)-> Compute-Node B ->(Control-Flow-Edge)-> Compute-Node C
      - Here, data flows from A to B, and then to C in `Aggregate`
      - Intermediate results can be passed using Data-Flow-Edges
2. Selection (Conditional Branching)
   - A Control-Node can be used to model conditional logic.
   - Depending on the condition, the Control-Node directs the flow to one of several outgoing Control-Flow-Edges leading to different Compute-Nodes.
   - Example:
     Control-Node (condition)
     ->  (Control-Flow-Edge true)    -> Compute-Node Then-Branch
     ->  (Control-Flow-Edge false)   -> Compute-Node Else-Branch
      - The Control-Node evaluates the condition and routes the execution to either Then-Branch or Else-Branch.
3. Iteration (Loops)
   - Loops can be modeled using Control-Nodes with cyclic Control-Flow-Edges back to earlier nodes, combined with State-Nodes to manage loop variables or counters.
   - A State-Node could be used to keep track of the loop’s state (e.g., a counter), while Control-Flow-Edges handle the loop’s execution flow.
   - Example:
     Control-Node (loop condition)
     ->(Control-Flow-Edge)-> Compute-Node (loop body)
     ->(State-Access-Edge)-> State-Node (loop counter)
     ->(Control-Flow-Edge back)-> Control-Node (loop condition)
   - The loop condition is checked in the Control-Node, which, if true, directs flow back to the loop body.
   - State-Nodes allow the loop to maintain state across iterations.

Envisioning a Structured Program Theorem for Your Computation Model
To formalize a structured program theorem within the Computation-Graph
1.	Define a minimal set of nodes and edges that can express `Aggregate`, selection, and iteration.
2.	Prove that any computation expressible in a traditional imperative style can be transformed into an equivalent directed graph using these constructs.
3.	Ensure that the graph remains acyclic, except for controlled cycles used for iteration (loops).
### Structured Computation-Graph Model
Reifying `Aggregate`, selection, and iteration using the Computation-Graph model.
Achieve modular system that aligns well with structured programming principles.
- Graph:
   - Nodes:
      - Control-Node: Manages control flow, decisions, and branching (if-then-else, loops).
      - Compute-Node: Performs data transformations and computations.
      - State-Node: Manages mutable state and maintains context (e.g., counters, accumulators).
   - Edges:
      - Control-Flow-Edge: Directs the flow of execution between nodes.
      - Data-Flow-Edge: Carries data outputs from one node to inputs of another.
      - State-Access-Edge: Provides access to shared state, allowing nodes to read or update state.
### Modeling Structured Control Constructs
1. `Aggregate`: Represents a linear `Aggregate` of computations.
   - Implementation:
   - Use a series of Compute-Nodes connected by Control-Flow-Edges.
   - Use Data-Flow-Edges to pass data between nodes if needed.
   - Example:
       ```
       Compute-Node A
           ->(Control-Flow-Edge)-> Compute-Node B
           ->(Control-Flow-Edge)-> Compute-Node C
       ```
   - Data can be passed between nodes via Data-Flow-Edges:
       ```
       A ->(Data-Flow-Edge)-> B ->(Data-Flow-Edge)-> C
       ```
2. Selection (Conditional Branching)
   - Concept: Models conditional execution based on a condition.
   - Implementation:
   - Use a Control-Node to evaluate the condition.
   - Depending on the evaluation, direct control flow to one of the branches using Control-Flow-Edges.
   - Example:
       ```
       Control-Node (condition)
           ->(Control-Flow-Edge true)-> Compute-Node Then-Branch
           ->(Control-Flow-Edge false)-> Compute-Node Else-Branch
       ```
   - The Control-Node evaluates the condition and routes execution to either the Then-Branch or the Else-Branch.
3. Iteration (Loops)
   - Concept: Models iterative computations with a controlled cycle.
   - Implementation:
   - Use a Control-Node to check the loop condition.
   - If the condition is true, direct control to the loop body using a Control-Flow-Edge.
   - Use a State-Node to manage loop variables (e.g., counters).
   - Example:
       ```
       Control-Node (loop condition)
           ->(Control-Flow-Edge)-> Compute-Node (loop body)
           ->(State-Access-Edge)-> State-Node (loop counter)
           ->(Control-Flow-Edge back)->Control-Node (loop condition)
       ```
   - The Control-Node checks the loop condition and directs flow back to the loop body if the condition is still true.
   - The State-Node maintains the loop’s state (like a counter).
### Potential Structured Program Theorem in the Computation-Graph
Given the model, we can envision a structured program theorem similar to the traditional structured programming concepts:
1.	Minimal Set of Constructs:
      - `Aggregate`, Selection, and Iteration can be expressed using a combination of Control-Nodes, Compute-Nodes, and the appropriate Edges.
2.	Completeness:
      - Any computation that can be expressed using imperative constructs can be transformed into an equivalent Computation-Graph using these nodes and edges.
      - The structured nature of the graph ensures that it can be easily reasoned about, making the system more predictable and analyzable.
3.	Acyclic with Controlled Cycles:
      - The computation graph remains acyclic except for controlled cycles used explicitly for iterations.
      - This guarantees that non-looping computations terminate and that cycles are explicitly managed by Control-Nodes, reducing the risk of unintended infinite loops.
### Advantages of the Structured Computation-Graph Model
1.	Clear Separation of Concerns:
      - By explicitly separating control flow, data flow, and state management, the model provides a clear structure for complex computational flows.
2.	Modularity and Reusability:
      - Nodes and edges can be defined and reused across different parts of the computation, promoting modular design.
3.	Parallelism and Concurrency:
      - The disentanglement of control flow and data flow allows for better parallel execution.
      - Nodes can be scheduled independently as long as their dependencies (edges) are satisfied.
4.	Formal Verification:
      - The graph structure can be analyzed for correctness, ensuring there are no deadlocks, race conditions, or other inefficiencies.
      - This model is more amenable to formal verification techniques since it provides a clear, explicit representation of control flow and data dependencies.
### Formalization
- develop **proof techniques** for demonstrating critical properties like **termination** and **correctness** using the formal language defined for the **Structured Computation-Graph Model**.
- this will be approached by:
   1. Defining **formal proof strategies** for key properties.
   2. Developing **invariants** and **rules** that will serve as the foundation for these proofs.
   3. Applying these techniques to a few examples to demonstrate how they work in practice.
#### 1. Formal Definitions and Preliminaries
Before diving into the proof techniques, let's establish some **notations** and **definitions** to set the stage:
- **Nodes**:
   - Let $N$ represent the set of all nodes in the computation graph.
   - Let $N_c, N_p, N_s$ be the subsets of Control-Nodes, Compute-Nodes, and State-Nodes, respectively.
- **Edges**:
   - Let $E \subseteq N \times N \times L$ represent the set of edges in the graph.
   - **Control-Flow Edges**: $E_{\text{cf}} \subseteq E$
   - **Data-Flow Edges**: $E_{\text{df}} \subseteq E$
   - **State-Access Edges**: $E_{\text{sa}} \subseteq E$
- **Functions**:
   - $\text{eval}(n)$ is the evaluation function of a node.
   - $\text{succ}(n)$ is the set of successor nodes connected to $n$ by edges.
   - $\text{pred}(n)$ is the set of predecessor nodes connected to $n$.
### 2. Proof Techniques for Termination
- **Definition**: A computation graph is said to **terminate** if there are no infinite control flow cycles except for explicitly defined loops that are guaranteed to exit based on a condition.
- **Proof Strategy**:
   - **Step 1: Identify Cycles in the Graph**
      - A **cycle** exists if there is a `Aggregate` of Control-Flow Edges $(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k, n_1)$ such that:
        $$
        (n_i, n_{i+1}, \text{Control-Flow}) \in E_{\text{cf}} \quad \text{for } 1 \leq i < k, \text{ and } (n_k, n_1, \text{Control-Flow}) \in E_{\text{cf}}
        $$
      - **Acyclic subgraphs**: If the graph $G = (N, E)$ is acyclic, it trivially terminates.
   - **Step 2: Identify Loops with Explicit Exit Conditions**
      - For each cycle involving a **Control-Node** $n_c$, verify that:
         - There exists a **State-Node** $n_s$ involved in the cycle with a State-Access Edge $(n_b, n_s, \text{State-Access})$ that updates the state.
         - The loop condition depends on the state maintained by $n_s$.
      - Define an **invariant** $I$ that holds before and after each iteration of the loop:
        $$
        I: \text{loop-counter} > 0 \implies \text{continue}, \quad \text{loop-counter} = 0 \implies \text{exit}
        $$
   - **Step 3: Induction Proof for Termination**
      - **Base Case**: When the loop starts, the **loop counter** is initialized to a positive value.
      - **Inductive Step**: After each iteration, the loop counter is decremented. The loop condition is checked using the Control-Node. If the counter reaches zero, the loop exits.
      - **Conclusion**: If the loop counter is bounded and decremented in each iteration, the loop **terminates**.
- **Example Proof**:
   - Consider the loop:
       ```
       Control-Node (loop condition)
           ->(Control-Flow-Edge)-> Compute-Node (loop body)
           ->(State-Access-Edge)-> State-Node (loop counter)
           ->(Control-Flow-Edge back)-> Control-Node (loop condition)
       ```
   - Let $n_s$ represent the State-Node holding the loop counter.
   - The invariant:
      - $I: \text{loop-counter} > 0 \implies \text{continue}$
      - The Control-Node decrements the loop counter and exits when $\text{loop-counter} = 0$.
### 3. Proof Techniques for Correctness
- **Definition**: A computation graph is said to be **correct** if:
   - Every Control-Node routes execution to the correct branch based on the condition.
   - Data-Flow and State-Access edges are used consistently, maintaining data integrity.
- **Proof Strategy**:
   - **Step 1: Define Invariants for Control-Nodes**
      - For each Control-Node $n_c$:
         - Let $C$ be the set of conditions evaluated by $n_c$.
         - Define an invariant $I_c$ such that:
           $$
           I_c: \text{if } \text{condition} = \text{true}, \text{ then route to } n_t; \text{ else route to } n_f
           $$
      - Ensure that all outgoing edges from $n_c$ lead to the correct branches:
        $$
        (n_c, n_t, \text{Control-Flow-Edge true}), \quad (n_c, n_f, \text{Control-Flow-Edge false})
        $$
   - **Step 2: Verify Data Integrity for Data-Flow and State-Access Edges**
      - For each Data-Flow Edge $(n_1, n_2, \text{Data-Flow})$:
      - Ensure that the data type produced by $n_1$ matches the expected input type of $n_2$.
      - Define an invariant $I_d$:
        $$
        I_d: \text{type}(n_1.\text{output}) = \text{type}(n_2.\text{input})
        $$
   - **Step 3: Consistency of State Operations**
      - For each State-Access Edge $(n_p, n_s, \text{State-Access})$:
         - Ensure that **read and write** operations on the state are consistent and do not lead to race conditions.
         - Define an invariant $I_s$:
           $$
           I_s: \text{state access by } n_p \text{ is atomic and consistent}
           $$
   - **Step 4: Reachability Analysis**
      - For correctness, ensure that every node that produces data is connected to at least one consumer.
      - Use a **reachability analysis** algorithm to check that all nodes are reachable from the entry Control-Node(s).
### 4. Applying the Proof Techniques: Example Walkthrough
Let’s apply these proof techniques to a simple example:
**Graph**:
1. **Nodes**:
   - $n_1$: Input (Compute-Node)
   - $n_c$: Condition Check (Control-Node)
   - $n_t$: True Branch (Compute-Node)
   - $n_f$: False Branch (Compute-Node)
   - $n_l$: Loop Condition (Control-Node)
   - $n_b$: Loop Body (Compute-Node)
   - $n_s$: Loop Counter (State-Node)
2. **Edges**:
   - `Aggregate`: $n_1 \rightarrow n_c$
   - Conditional: $n_c \rightarrow_{\text{true}} n_t$, $n_c \rightarrow_{\text{false}} n_f$
   - Loop: $n_l \rightarrow_{\text{true}} n_b$, $n_b \rightarrow n_s$, $n_s \rightarrow n_l$
     **Proof**:
1. **Termination**:
   - The loop counter decreases each time $n_b$ executes. The loop exits when the counter reaches zero.
2. **Correctness**:
   - The condition in $n_c$ correctly routes execution to $n_t$ or $n_f$.
   - Data types between nodes match, ensuring no data integrity issues.
3. **Reachability**:
   - All nodes are reachable from the entry point $n_1$.
### Conclusion
- These proof techniques allow us to rigorously analyze the properties of **termination**, **correctness**, and **reachability** in your **Computation-Graph model**.
- By formalizing these concepts, we can ensure that complex computations are structured correctly and reliably.
